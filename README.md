I am a fresher belonging to Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. I like playing and 
watching football (Huge fan of Gareth Bale).
I want to contribute to open source because when we commit changes to an 
open source work, we become a part of that work. It will give me a huge 
pride to see my changes being implemented, and I would be happy that I was 
able to help someone.
